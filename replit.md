# PhotoSphere - Professional Event Photography Portal

## Overview

PhotoSphere is a cutting-edge, professional-grade Flask web application designed for event photography management and community engagement. The platform features modern glassmorphism design, smooth animations, and comprehensive photo management capabilities. Built with Python Flask backend, Bootstrap 5 frontend, and SQLAlchemy ORM, it demonstrates full-stack development excellence suitable for job interviews and professional portfolios.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy with Flask-SQLAlchemy integration
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login for session management
- **Image Processing**: Pillow (PIL) for thumbnail generation and image manipulation
- **Security**: Werkzeug for password hashing and file handling

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 (Flask's default)
- **CSS Framework**: Bootstrap 5 with dark theme
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla ES6+ for interactive features
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.0
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Bootstrap's grid system

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication and profile management
- **Albums**: Photo organization with visibility controls
- **Photos**: Image metadata and file management
- **Comments**: User engagement on photos
- **Relationships**: One-to-many relationships between users-albums, albums-photos, and photos-comments

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- User registration and login with secure password hashing
- Role-based access control (user/admin)
- Session management with Flask-Login
- Protected routes for authenticated users

### Photo Management
- Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- File validation (type, size, format)
- Automatic thumbnail generation
- Image metadata storage
- Support for multiple image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP)

### Album Organization
- Album creation and management
- Public/private visibility settings
- Photo organization within albums
- Creator ownership and permissions

### Comment System
- User commenting on individual photos
- Comment display and management
- Integration with photo detail views

### Admin Panel
- System statistics dashboard
- User and content management
- Content moderation capabilities

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration/Login**: User creates account → Password hashed → Session created
2. **Photo Upload**: File selected → Validated → Uploaded to server → Thumbnail generated → Metadata stored in database
3. **Album Creation**: User creates album → Album metadata stored → Photos can be added
4. **Photo Viewing**: User requests photo → Database query → File served → Comments loaded
5. **Comment Creation**: User submits comment → Validation → Database storage → Display update
